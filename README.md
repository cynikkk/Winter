# Winter

Winter is a hacked client with the mail goal of experimenting with Java and related stuff on Minecraft.
There are a lot of subjects involving programming and reverse engineering, so it's a good starting point to learn some new stuff.

# What is planned ?

To be honest, there's not much for now. But if I'd have to quote some :
- Flyhack
- Player / Entities ESP
- Kill aura
- Interact with water
- Xray

I'll probably add more but that's my main goal.

# How to build ?

`./gradlew build`

The project is being made with [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and [Minecraft Dev](https://mcdev.io) plugin.
